## Check Permutation

*Given 2 strings write a method to decide if one is a permutaion of the other*

- Permutation means all character counts match

- If lengths not equal return false

- Hash map of both to count individual characters
    - Increase in string 1
    - Decrease in string 2

- If any key is not zero return false
